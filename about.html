<phead>About Me</phead>
	<p>I am a Software Engineer working at an educational games studio in the midwest. My work there is currently under NDA, but my current focus in my job is Unity and C# Game Development on multi-platform games.</p>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Wisonsin-Madison B.S. Computer Science in May of 2019. During my time in College I was an officer in both the UW-Madison Game Design and Development Club and the Madison Student Chapter of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). I learned a lot about the design and development process during this time and made multiple prototypes and fleshed some out into full games.</p>
	<p>Besides my passion for game design, coding, and writing, other hobbies include competitive three-event and show-ski waterskiing, playing board games and D&D with friends, and taking care of my two corn snakes.</p>
