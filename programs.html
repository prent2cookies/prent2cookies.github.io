	<p>The website you are looking at I coded from scratch with HTML and CSS, no website-making software involved beyond a text editor. As a Computer Science major, I have a very strong background in coding and this is one example of both my coding and design abilities.</p>
	<p>In addition to all the school assignments and projects I have done as a part of a Computer Science curriculum as well as the coding I have done for the games I have listed on the Games tab, I also have participated in the website Codewars to challenge my analytical thinking. I you would like an in-depth look, my various code examples and other work are posted on my GitHub.</p>
