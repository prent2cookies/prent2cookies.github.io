	<p>Below are some key examples of games I led or heavily assisted in working on.</p>
	<p>OwlQuest is a cute, family-friendly strategic game where you collect various resources on the board to complete enough
		quests to win the game before other players can. This game was completed in a group of four, where my main contributions
		were in the wireframe, flowcharting and general game design, and Unity coding as well as more minor contributions to style. </p>

	<p>Greedy Midas is a two-player competitive game where each player wants to claim over half of the rooms on the board before
		the other. This game is currently being made with one other person, and I led this project. The first few prototypes are
		compete, and is being coded to Unity.</p>

	<p>1861: Life on the Battlefield was an ambitious analog strategy board game made in my Game Design class with two other people.
		One player controls four civilians and the other controls one soldier, and the goal of the game is to survive 15 rounds. While
		it may be advantageous to be cooperative, the game is meant to be very difficult to survive so the players may turn on eachother
	to get the resources they need.</p>

	<p>Joker 28 was a challenge to make any game you can think of within an hour given a box with playing cards, dice, and various other
		 trinkets that you can opt to use. Joker 28 is a short-round deception game where the "joker" wants to stop the players from reaching
		  28 points by the time they run out of cards.</p>
